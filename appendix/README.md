# Appendix

This is a series of **Controlled Architectural Experiments** in **Persistent Reasoning**.
Each Appendix is ​​an isolated puzzle, not a system. It's Boundary Proof, not a Product.

Appendix materials extend, contextualize, or stress-test the core architecture.
They do not define it.

The goal is not to demonstrate capability.
The goal is to remove ambiguity.

Each piece moves the architecture one step closer to something that could survive production -
not by becoming more powerful, but by becoming more disciplined.
