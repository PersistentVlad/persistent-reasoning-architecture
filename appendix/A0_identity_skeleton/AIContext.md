# AI Context — A0 Identity Skeleton

## Scope

Executable validation of identity boundary separation between inference and persistence.

Local to Appendix A0.

## Formal Problem

Determine whether reasoning identity can survive repeated inference cycles if:

- inference has no write authority,
- persistence is append-only,
- commitment is explicitly governed.

## Definitions

Identity:
Continuity of append-only lineage across iterations.

Inference:
Stateless proposal generator without persistence authority.

Commitment:
Explicit governance act that promotes a proposal to persistent structure.

## State Model

Initial State:
Empty or minimally initialized append-only store.

Transformation Set:
Proposal objects generated by inference stub.

State Constraints:
- No in-place mutation
- No overwrite
- No deletion without lineage
- No query evaluation

## Structural Invariants

1. Persistent structures are append-only.
2. Only the write barrier can mutate persistence.
3. Inference cannot directly modify persistent state.
4. Commitment is explicit and separable.

## Execution Flow

1. Load persistent structure (read-only).
2. Run inference stub.
3. Generate proposal object.
4. Pass proposal through write barrier.
5. Commit or reject via commit gate.
6. Advance iteration.

## Code Architecture

Entry Point:
code/run_minimal_loop.py

Core Modules:
- persistent_store.py
- write_barrier.py
- proposal_engine.py
- commit_gate.py
- inference_stub.py

Data Flow:
Inference → Proposal → Commit Gate → Append-Only Store

## Evaluation Criteria

Valid:
- Explicit proposal–commit separation
- No implicit learning
- Deterministic execution order
- Structural continuity observable over time

Invalid:
- Direct store mutation by inference
- Automatic consolidation
- Query-based structural evaluation
- Silent regeneration

Failure Conditions:
- Constraint violation triggers halt
- Write barrier bypass detected
- Lineage corruption

## Architectural Impact

Supports:
- Write Authority Discipline
- Identity via Lineage
- Governance-Separated Persistence

Constrains:
- Optimization pressure
- Learning integration
- Query semantics

Does Not Redefine:
- Semantic identity models
- Recovery mechanisms
- Higher-order persistent reasoning layers
